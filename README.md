TAFRC stands for tool assisted FRC. It consists of a few modules, written to help my robotics team in the upcoming competition season.
FRC is an acronym, standing for FIRST Robotics Competition. It's a well-recognized national competition that begins with a project introduction in early January, and qualifiers for nationals throughout the spring season.

In the previous season (2019-2020), the challenge involved shooting balls to a reasonable degree of precision through vertical "goals". As such, teams would build shooters to shoot the field element balls through these goals.

These modules I've written help map out the path of balls that are shot out of robot shooters. They integrate into the software team's code, determining the position of the balls. The vision system on the robot plans the angle and force that the ball is shot out from, with the knowledge of the ball's path.
